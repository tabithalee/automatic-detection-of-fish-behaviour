# Automatic Detection Of Fish Behaviour

A summer NSERC project focussing on detecting startle-type fish behaviour with opencv and python. More information about the project can be found in [paper]

## Getting Started
The following steps will help get a running copy on your local machine for testing and development.

### Prerequisites
You will need to have python 3.5 installed on your computer as well as the python OpenCV [version] framework. Some other libraries needed are [include libraries]

### Installing
Once the pre-requisites are installed, you should be able to run the code in Final Version. 

Ensure when running that you have the correct version of Python and OpenCV. This can be done by [how].

## Deployment
Each method attempted in [paper] can be run from the command line for testing purposes. These are
[include the different attempts]
* Segmentation
[example for each attempt]
* Segmentation - All default parameters are stored in config.py

[TODO - word this better]
You can run all the videos in the high quality category with the flag 'all'
