# Automatic Detection Of Fish Behaviour

A summer NSERC project focussing on detecting startle-type fish behaviour with opencv and python. More information about the project can be found in the NSERC USRA 2019 pdf file

## Getting Started
The following steps will help get a running copy on your local machine for testing and development.

### Prerequisites
You will need to have at least Python 3.5.2 installed on your computer as well as the python OpenCV 2.4.1.0 framework. Ensure when running that you have the correct version of Python and OpenCV, as previous versions are not completely compatible with the code. Some other libraries needed are used such as numpy and matplotlib, but you can install them as necessary.

Once the pre-requisites are installed, you should be able to run the code in Final- Version. This is where all the code mentioned in the paper is. All other folders are development code and therefore not clean.

## Deployment
The two
[include the different attempts]
* Segmentation
[example for each attempt]
* Segmentation - All default parameters are stored in config.py

[TODO - word this better]
You can run all the videos in the high quality category with the flag 'all'
